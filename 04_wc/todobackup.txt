"Make a wc command which shows lines, word and charcter with its sub-command" 
 

1.Get code scaffold ready------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[5 min]                                                                          
   ✔ folder, bash, sublime, runtest, wc, one.txt, test @done (14-09-24 10:28)

2.take filename or text from user.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------[30 min]
  *wc should take any file name or text .

3.create a function that check the user input is valid.------------------------------------------------------------[30 min]
  *I have to use existsSync(filename) command to find the file is in current directory or not.

4.create a function that read the file and take text from it.------------------------------------------------------[10 min]
  *I have to use readFileSync(file) command and use utf8 to retrive text from file.

5.create a function that go through the text and count the characters of that given text.--------------------------[30 min]
  *take text split it and go through each char and count every time.

6.create a function that count the word of that given text .-------------------------------------------------------[30 min]
  *take text split it and go through each word and count every time.

7.create a function that count (\n) and give number of the line of that given text.--------------------------------[40 min]
  *I have split text on (\n) and count the length.

8.create a function that count the length of lines of that given text for finding the longest line.----------------[30 min]
  *go through each line and find the length of every line and compare them and find the longest line.

9.create a function that help the user and show all the options of wc with its work.-------------------------------[30 min]
  *print text file content that gives all information about wc --help command.

10.implement option(-c) so that when it call it give only count of character.--------------------------------------[45 min]
  *I have to read file contant using readFileSync(filename) and find the length of text and print it.

11.implement option(--bytes) so that when it call it give only count of character.---------------------------------[45 min]
  *I have to read file contant using readFileSync(filename) and find the length of text and print it.

12.implement option(-chars) so that when it call it give  only count of character.---------------------------------[40 min]
  *I have to read file contant using readFileSync(filename) and find the length of text and print it.

13.implement option(-l) so that when it call it give  only count of lines.-----------------------------------------[40 min]
  *I have to split text on (\n) and count it and print the count.

14.implement option(--lines) so that when it call it give  only count of lines.------------------------------------[30 min]
  *I have to split text on (\n) and count it and print the count.

15.implement option(-w) so that when it call it give  only count of word.------------------------------------------[45 min]
  *I have to split the text on space and filter extra space and count the words.

16.implement option(--words) so that when it call it give  only count of words.------------------------------------[30 min]
  *I have to split the text on space and filter extra space and count the words.




17.implement option(-L) so that when it call it give  only count of character of longest line.----------------------[45 min]
  *I have to split text on (\n) and reduce it and find longest line and print the count of line.

18.implement option(--max-line-length) so that when it call it give only count of character of longestline.---------[30 min]
  *I have to split text on (\n) and reduce it and find longest line and print the count of line.

19.create a function that give the path of a file.------------------------------------------------------------------[20 min]
  *I have to use fs.realpathSync("file_name") to find the path of file.
